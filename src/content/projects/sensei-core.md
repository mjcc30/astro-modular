**Sensei Core** is a high-performance, distributed AI Agent Swarm written in Rust. It replaces the legacy Python engine with a memory-safe, concurrent architecture capable of RAG, Tool Execution, and Multi-Model Reasoning.

## ✨ Features

- **🐝 Agent Swarm:** Specialized agents (Red Team, Blue Team, Cloud, Crypto) orchestrated by a Router.
- **🧠 Smart Routing:** Automatically routes queries to the best agent.
- **📚 RAG:** Ingest documents and retrieve context.
- **🛠️ Tool Execution:** Run system commands securely.
