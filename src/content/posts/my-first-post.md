## Welcome to My Astro Modular Blog!

This is my very first post, created using the Astro Modular theme. I'm excited to share my thoughts and knowledge with you.

### Obsidian-Friendly Features

One of the coolest things about Astro Modular is its compatibility with Obsidian. This means I can use familiar syntax like [[Wikilinks]] directly in my markdown files, and they'll be rendered correctly on the blog.

For example, here's a link to the [[Getting Started]] post.

### Images

Embedding images is also straightforward. I can reference them using Obsidian's wikilink syntax for images, as shown in the frontmatter of this post. Make sure your images are in the `public/` directory or a subdirectory, and then link them relative to that. For instance, `[[attachments/sample-image.png]]` assumes `sample-image.png` is in `public/attachments/`.

Here's an example of an image inline:

![[attachments/another-image.jpeg]]

### What's Next?

I'll be exploring more features of Astro Modular and sharing my journey here. Stay tuned for more posts on web development, cloud-native technologies, and personal productivity!
